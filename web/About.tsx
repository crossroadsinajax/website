      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Crossroads Community Church has been in Ajax since 1995. Since 2009 we
        have been meeting at Bolton C. Falby Public School, which is at Falby
        Court in Ajax, ON. Crossroads is a member of the Christian Reformed
        Church in Canada, a Protestant denomination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area surrounding Falby Court is a diversely populated area with a
        blend of young families and seniors, both new to Canada and established.
        Both the privileged and the underserved in our community have material
        needs. The needs are great, but God is greater. He is at work here. As
        followers of Jesus Christ we are committed to working with Him — not
        just building a church but building a community in Christ! We believe
        that God began this good work here, and He will see it through to
        completion!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Connecting</b> people with Jesus
        <br />
        <b>Becoming</b> like Him, and
        <br />
        <b>Demonstrating</b> His love!
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this mean? A disciple is a follower of Jesus, someone that is…
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CONNECTED to Jesus through a close, personal relationship,</li>
        <li>BECOMING more like Jesus in character and purpose,</li>
        <li>
          DEMONSTRATING the kind of love that Jesus did, for God and for people.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are first of all committed to being disciples, and find our purpose
        by helping others find theirs through mentoring and discipleship.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are convinced the world would be a better place if people actually
        lived and loved like Jesus did. To that end, we have a vision for making
        disciples here in our own community. That vision is tied to where God
        has placed us in downtown Ajax.

      <h1>Our beliefs</h1>
      <p>
        <b>We believe in God</b> — Do you believe that there is a God? We do!
        This is a core conviction, one that shapes our whole way of living and
        thinking. We are not alone. Most people believe in ‘God’ in some way. We
        believe that God is personal and powerful, and certainly beyond our
        ability to understand or explain Him. We believe that He created the
        world for us to enjoy with Him, and that He created it good & perfect!{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        We urge you to think long and hard about this, because if there is a
        God, it will have huge implications for you – and for everyone!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>We believe in the Bible</b> — This book is amazing. Written over a
        period of 1500 years, yet all its chapters tell one story – from
        creation, to the fall into sin, to God’s rescue operation, and
        ultimately to the new (restored) creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that this book, though written in the language and culture of
        specific historical periods, remains the unfailing message of God for
        all people, revealing His will and His way to true life and joy! We
        believe that the Bible is meant to be followed, and that we must
        continuously reform our lives according to its direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>We believe in Sin</b> — By this we mean that we believe there is
        something terribly wrong in the world, and terribly wrong in us. This is
        not the world as God created it! All people, including you and us, have
        spiritual heart problems – we are selfish and self-centered to the core
        – and this explains why despite our best efforts, we cannot make this
        world a better place.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Until we are ready to admit this, we are not ready to get the help we so
        desperately need. And we will continue to wander through life… lost!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>We believe in Jesus Christ</b> — We believe that Jesus Christ – who
        lived on earth 2000 years ago – was the Son of God in human flesh, Who
        came to save us from sin, death and hell, and to help us find our way
        back to God! We believe that He modeled perfectly the life that God
        originally designed us to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that His sacrificial death removed the death penalty hanging
        over our heads. We believe that He was resurrected to life, and now by
        the Spirit living in us, we too can be restored to new life –
        everlasting life! And we believe that the only way for you to experience
        and enjoy this is by admitting your sin, believing in Jesus, and
        committing yourself to living life with Him!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>We believe in Eternal Life… and Eternal Death</b> — Although we don’t
        know the specifics, we do believe that all people are heading in one of
        two directions, either towards God (and eternal life) or away from God
        (and eternal death). This is not a cruel joke, nor is it God’s way of
        getting revenge. We are responsible for the direction of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is constantly calling us, inviting us to eternal life with Him;
        warning us of the consequences of rejecting Him. He doesn’t want us to
        perish – He sent His Son to rescue us – but in the end, if we refuse to
        respond, we get what we asked for. Yes, “hell” is ultimately getting
        what we wanted – eternal life without God.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>We believe in the Church</b> — Yes, we know, the church has had a
        very poor track record through history. But we believe in the Church as
        God intended it to be – just like Jesus! The church is supposed to carry
        on where Jesus left off – serving people in their need, calling them to
        return to God, sacrificing themselves for the good of their neighbour,
        putting God first in the daily details of life, and being used by God to
        miraculously bless people! This is not what the church is known for –
        but we are committed to being God’s kind of Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We believe in You!</b> — This is not some kind of positive thinking
        mumbo jumbo. We believe that you are a sinner, that you need God’s help,
        that you need Jesus Christ to be forgiven and restored to God’s family.
        But we also believe that you are God’s child, that with God in your
        life, you are a gifted and important member of the human race. God can
        do amazing things through you.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        He wants you to make a difference in the world by surrendering yourself
        to Him! Can you imagine what this world would be like if people actually
        started living like God wanted them to, like Jesus did? God is prepared
        to do this in you… are you?

      <h1>Becoming a Christian</h1>
      <p>
        God loves all people, but He is hurt and angry at the many ways we
        reject Him and disobey His moral laws, how we mess up His world and
        treat others cruelly.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        God created this world – and you – to be happy and at peace, but instead
        He sees sin and misery. Therefore God has entered into this world
        through Jesus Christ, His Son, to make things right.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to be rescued from the penalty and power of sin, we need to
        admit that we are sinners, believe in Jesus as our Saviour and Lord, and
        commit ourselves with His help to living holy and loving lives.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          I <b>A</b>dmit that I am a sinner, and that I need Jesus to save me
          from the penalty and power of my sin.
        </li>
        <li>
          I <b>B</b>elieve in Jesus as my Savior; I believe that I am God’s
          child and that His Spirit lives in me.
        </li>
        <li>
          I <b>C</b>ommit myself to obeying Jesus as my Lord, to serving Him
          with my life, and to actively sharing in the mission of His church.
