# TODO/brainstorming

- [ ] find out how volunteer schedules are managed
- [ ] figure out navigation
- [ ] collapsible service sections
- [ ] when service is "active" (during/before)
- [ ] when audio/video is available after service post player at the top (or should be sticky to page)
- [ ] all sections collapse when service is over

- [ ] real-time
  - [ ] follow-through of service (power-point guys would "advance the service")
  - [ ] mute feature to turn screen black during prayer, etc


POST APPROVAL
- [ ] log-in logic
